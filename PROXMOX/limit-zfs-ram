ZFS uses 50 % of the host memory for the Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) by default. Allocating enough memory for the ARC is crucial for IO performance, so reduce it with caution. As a general rule of thumb, allocate at least 2 GiB Base + 1 GiB/TiB-Storage. For example, if you have a pool with 8 TiB of available storage space then you should use 10 GiB of memory for the ARC.

You can change the ARC usage limit for the current boot (a reboot resets this change again) by writing to the zfs_arc_max module parameter directly:

echo "$[10  _1024_1024*1024]" >/sys/module/zfs/parameters/zfs_arc_max

To permanently change the ARC limits create the file: /etc/modprobe.d/zfs.conf and write memory limits in it : (for example, this is for 16G max and 4G min)

options zfs zfs_arc_max=17179869184

options zfs zfs_arc_min=4294967296

Save that file, then execute update-initramfs -u

Reboot.

You should now have limited ZFS to 4 GB ram usage.

It's true that on Linux ZFS does not relase RAM.
