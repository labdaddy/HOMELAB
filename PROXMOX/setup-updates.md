- Next, click the upgrade button.
- A new browser window will open, detailing which updates are going to be installed, and prompting you to continue, you can just press enter here to kick things off.
- When it has finished, you will be returned to the bash shell prompt and itâ€™s safe to close this window out after you check to see if a reboot is required, there will be a message displayed at the end of the update if this is the case, as in the screenshot below.
