### CREATE A MINIMAL UBUNTU SERVER CLOUD IMAGE
- start the VM creation process
- On the General tab: assign a number to the VM, provide a name, click next
- On the OS tab: on ISO image select `Do not use any media`, next
- On the System tab: click the box for `Qemu agent`, next
- On the Disks tab: delete the storage disk displayed in the little box on the left side of the popup window, next
- On the CPU tab: select cores, next
- On the Memory tab: select memory, next
- On the Network tab: choose the network you want and make sure `VirtIO (paravirtualized)` is selected, next
- On the Confirm tab: review, make sure `Start after created` is NOT selected, click `Finish`
- Once the VM is created go to the hardware tab for that new VM and select the `Cloudinit Drive`
- On the popup choose local storage or whatever other storage provider you want to use then click add
- Then go to the Cloud-Init section on the left (the section below Summary, not CloudInit drive attached to the machine) and click it
- On this tab click `User` and enter the name you want
- Then click on `Password` and enter the password you want
- Then on `SSH key`, if you have a public SSH key you would like to use for this machine go ahead and add it here
- Then on `Network`, set to DCHP (or don't, depending on your network needs)
- Then click `Regenerate image`.
- Open the shell on the proxmox host or SSH in and access the shell that way
- Download the ubuntu cloud image using: `wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/minimal/releases/jammy/release/ubuntu-22.04-minimal-cloudimg-amd64.img`
- Once thats done, you need to run a qm command on the shell: `qm set <VM ID> --serial0 socket --vga serial0`
- For some currently unknown reason, the recently downloaded image needs to be renamed so the file type is qcow2. Use this command: `mv ubuntu-22.04-minimal-cloudimg-amd64.img ubuntu-22.04.qcow2' The name could be whatever you want just make sure the extension is changed to qcow2.
- Next the drive size needs to be selected with: `qemu-img resize ubuntu-22.04.qcow2 32G` Use whatever size you want, doesn't need to be 32G .
- Next we need to import the disk to Proxmox with `qm importdisk 900 ubuntu-22.04.qcow2 local-lvm`. Local lvm does not need to be used, just replace with whatever storage location you intend to use.
